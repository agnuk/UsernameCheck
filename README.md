Hello everyone!)

The Mass Checking Telegram Usernames project is a web application developed using Flask and deployed with Waitress. This tool allows users to efficiently check the availability of multiple Telegram usernames simultaneously, providing a streamlined solution for individuals and businesses looking to secure their desired usernames on the popular messaging platform.

The running version is availble at:

Usernamecheck.ru

Features

Batch Username Checking: Users can input a list of usernames to check their availability in bulk, saving time compared to manual checks.
Real-Time Results: The application provides immediate feedback on the status of each username, indicating whether it is available or already taken.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with a clean and intuitive web interface, making it accessible for users of all technical levels.
Flask Framework: Leveraging Flask's robust capabilities for web development, ensuring a scalable and maintainable codebase.
Waitress Deployment: Utilizes Waitress as the WSGI server for serving the application, ensuring reliability and performance.

Technical Details

Backend: The application is built using Python with the Flask framework. It handles user requests, processes username checks, and serves results dynamically.
Frontend: The user interface is designed using HTML and CSS, providing an engaging experience for users submitting username requests.
Deployment: The application runs on a server configured with Waitress, allowing it to handle multiple requests efficiently.

Installation Instructions

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
"cd ~"
"git clone https://github.com/agnuk/UsernameCheck"
I would rename the folder to flask-app   
"mv UsernameCheck flask-app"

Set Up a Virtual Environment:

bash
"python3 -m venv venv"
"source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`"


Install Dependencies:

bash
"pip install -r requirements.txt"

Run the Application:

bash

"waitress-serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8080 app:app"

Access the Application:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080 to start using the tool.

Okay, now if you do not have nginx server, it should be installed:


Installing Nginx:

Step 1: Install Nginx
Update Package Index:
bash
"sudo apt update"

Install Nginx:
bash

"sudo apt install nginx"

Check Nginx Status:

After installation, ensure that Nginx is running:

bash

"sudo systemctl status nginx"

Step 2: Configure Nginx as a Reverse Proxy

Create an Nginx Server Block:
Create a configuration file for your application:
bash

"sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp.conf"

Add the Following Configuration:

Replace your_domain.com with your actual domain or IP address:

text

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain.com www.your_domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;  # Change port if needed for Waitress
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}

Enable the Server Block:
Create a symbolic link to enable the configuration:
bash
"sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/"

Test the Nginx Configuration:

Ensure there are no syntax errors in your configuration:
bash

"sudo nginx -t"

Restart Nginx:

Apply the changes by restarting Nginx:
bash

"sudo systemctl restart nginx"


Now, lets make waitress running all the time:

Step 1: Create a Systemd Service File

Open a terminal on your server.

Create a new service file for your Flask application. You can name it waitress.service:
bash

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/flask-app.service

Add the following configuration to the service file, adjusting paths and user as necessary:

text

[Unit]
Description=Flask Application running with Waitress
After=network.target

[Service]
User=your_username          # Replace with your actual username
Group=www-data              # You can change this if needed
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/flask-app  # Adjust to your app's directory
ExecStart=/path/to/your/venv/bin/waitress-serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8080 app:app  # Adjust the path to your virtual environment and app
Restart=always               # Restart service if it crashes

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Step 2: Enable and Start the Service
Reload systemd to recognize the new service:
bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
Enable the service to start on boot:
bash
sudo systemctl enable flask-app.service
Start the service immediately:
bash
sudo systemctl start flask-app.service
Step 3: Check the Status of Your Service
To verify that your service is running correctly, use:
bash
sudo systemctl status flask-app.service
This command will show you whether the service is active and running.
Step 4: View Logs for Debugging (if necessary)
If you encounter issues, you can check the logs for more information:
bash
journalctl -u flask-app.service -f


Usage

Enter multiple usernames in the provided input field (one per line).
Click the "Check Availability" button.
View the results displayed on the page, showing which usernames are available or taken.
